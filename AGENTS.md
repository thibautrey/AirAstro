# Guidelines for Codex Agents

This repository is a monorepo consisting of mobile applications and a Raspberry Pi server. The folder layout is:

- `apps/ios` – iOS application sources
- `apps/android` – Android application sources
- `server` – server side code intended for Raspberry Pi

There are no automated tests yet. Agents do not need to run any test commands when modifying files.
