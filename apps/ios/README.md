# iOS App

This folder contains the Xcode project for the AirAstro iOS application. The project is a SwiftUI app with a simple network manager used to communicate with the Raspberry Pi server.

## Structure

- `AirAstroApp.swift` – entry point for the SwiftUI application.
- `ContentView.swift` – basic UI showing connection status.
- `NetworkManager.swift` – lightweight helper for HTTP requests to the server.
- `Info.plist` – minimal application configuration.

## Building

Open the `AirAstro` folder in Xcode and run the app in the simulator or on an iOS device.
